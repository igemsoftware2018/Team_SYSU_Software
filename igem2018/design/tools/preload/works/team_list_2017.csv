","Decreasing fresh water availability is not only a problem for desert climate regions like North-Africa and the Middle East, but also for European countries like Germany or the Netherlands, where water pollution is mainly caused by industry.
We are modifying the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to increase the uptake of various ions into the cell and store these inside its vacuole. This will be achieved by upregulation of native (vacuolar) ion importers and knock-out of ion exporters. Furthermore, we are expressing heterologous genes from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in yeast to improve vacuolar ion accumulation, thus creating a microbial dustbin.
With this newly generated library of genetically engineered yeasts, we hope to offer a novel way of treating water contaminated by industrial processes and store pollutants in our intracellular reservoir, the Salt Vault. Then this concept can be employed by industries facing problems with high pollution in their process water.

","Acne vulgaris affects 85% of adolescents at some point of their life, influencing their self-esteem negatively. Currently, antibiotics are among the most common acne treatments. However, 50% of bacteria associated with acne are already resistant to the antibiotics used. Our project aims to develop a novel treatment for acne using an antimicrobial peptide, dermcidin, naturally found in human sweat. Dermcidin has shown to be active against Propionibacterium acnes, the bacterium associated with acne.  Patients with acne also have reduced expression of dermcidin, which suggests that it might contribute to the condition. We aim to produce dermcidin tied to a cellulose-binding domain, which would enable the immobilization of the peptide on a cellulose surface. This would allow the usage of dermcidin in various skin care products, such as hydrogel masks and exfoliation pads.

One of the major pre-requirements for a successful directed evolution of proteins is a simple, fast and cost-efficient method for generating genetic diversity. Many technologies have been used during the years to propagate mutations. One of them is mutator strains, which carry defects in one or more of their DNA repair genes. A large number of gene knock-out, transcriptional or translational silencing methods were applied for mutator strain generation. Regardless of its great potential, the CRISPR guided dCas9 targeting to transcriptional start sites of bacterial DNA repair genes was not among them.

The identification of dangerous arsenic concentrations in groundwater and soil is important because arsenic poses a serious health risk to living organisms. Unfortunately, arsenic testing is expensive, time consuming, and requires sophisticated equipment. This is especially relevant to soldiers deployed to resource-scarce, field environments. Our team is using synthetic biology to develop a more affordable, portable, and accessible means of testing. We designed a plasmid that uses ArsR, a negative transcriptional repressor, to regulate the expression of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). In the presence of arsenic, ArsR will undergo a conformational change that allows GFP expression. The assay is performed using a low cost paper ticket made by Edgewood Chemical Biological Center and analyzed with ultraviolet light. The development of this circuit would provide an inexpensive way to evaluate arsenic contamination.

","In stock-breeding, animals are fed with grains that contain phytic acids though many livestock are not capable of producing phytase, an enzyme that decomposes phytic acid, and remaining phytic acid is excreted in the excrement. Excreted phytic acid flows into rivers and leads to eutrophication that causes problems such as red tide, which exerts adverse effects on ecosystem and fishery.
Under the status quo, people try to cope with this problem by adding phytase to the feed of livestock however, its enzyme activity is thought to be lowered when it is heated during its production. Moreover, the low pH in the stomach of livestock may also lower its activity.
In our project, we aim to increase stability against heat and extreme pH by circularizing enzyme using self-assembling peptides (SAPs) which could decrease the amount of phosphate in the excrement and enhance nutrition absorption since phytic acids chelate minerals.

Different approaches of genetic containment strategy such as kill-switches and auxotrophic mutants pose some issues of horizontal gene transfer of modified genes and metabolic cross-feeding that may limit the effectiveness of those approaches. To circumvent the shortcomings, we present an alternative safety circuit which is capable of sensing and amplifying a signalling molecule under a time-delay mechanism.

","Printer ink is a commodity that is used on a daily basis. The current pigments used to colour conventional inks are environmentally harmful to produce. Our goal is to produce biological pigments by putting the biosynthesis pathway genes encoding for black, cyan, magenta, and yellow pigments into Escherichia coli. Using synthetic biology to produce pigments may provide a cleaner and safer alternative to conventional pigment manufacturing. Costs of manufacturing methods can be compared and pigment production yields can be modeled mathematically. Pigments purified from bacteria are combined with a solvent and resin to create an ink mixture. Consultation with potential stakeholders indicated that pigments and inks produced by this method would need to be tested for bleaching, bleeding and colour consistency, among other characteristics. Additional human practices include analyzing the environmental impact of standard pigment production versus bacterial production and presenting iGEM and STEAM initiatives to members of our community.

At the activation temperature, gating of the thermal actuator allows for an influx of extracellular calcium ions, which initiate the calmodulin-calcineurin signaling pathway, and promote the expression of genes regulated by Crz1p-sensitive promoters. The characterization of the thermal actuator was conducted in S. cerevisiae because yeast offers an accessible eukaryotic chassis for other iGEM teams to work with. By varying the temperature, the thermal actuator can be used to control genetic circuits that function as temperature-sensitive kill switches, drug delivery devices, or biosensors.

The goal of our project is to develop a strategy to treat obesity, with building a transplantable system targeting a specific molecule that functions in white fat tissue. We packed siRNA into exosomes (nano-sized vesicles secreted by human cells). Then we modified our exosome with a certain peptide to act as white-fat-tissue-specific targeting tool. The siRNA will function to bring out the apoptosis of fat tissue. Our validation experiments will be carried out at the level of cells and animals (mice) to prove both the targeting and function of siRNA. Eventually, we expect to see a specific accumulation of the siRNA in the mices white fat tissue and the decrease of mices fat and their weights. This project may provide new insights into future treatment of obesity.

","A recent analysis of Americas drinking water for carcinogenic hexavalent chromium (CrVI) revealed over 218 million Americans consume CrVI at levels exceeding a de minimis lifetime cancer risk. Our team attempted to solve this problem by engineering Shewanella oneidensis to reduce CrVI to its less toxic form (CrIII) in contaminated wastewater. We enhanced reduction via expression of a mutated chromate reductase enzyme (chrR6) and increased chromate permeability via over-expression of sulfate transporter and binding proteins (cysP,U,W,A and sbp). Addressing biocontainment, we included a kill switch where low CrVI levels signaled expression of a toxin (BamHI). Laboratory work has been completed in model organism Escherichia coli; future work includes characterizing the circuit in S. oneidensis. To assess real-world feasibility, we developed bioreactor- and cell-scale simulations of our engineered bacteria in an activated sludge secondary treatment system aimed at determining the kinetics of Cr(VI) remediation and cell death.

","Sophorolipids are a group of amphipathic compounds synthesized by yeasts, including our selected chassis Starmerella bombicola. These compounds are among the most industrially viable biosurfactants. As surfactants, sophorolipids are superior to current synthetic alternatives largely due to their low toxicity and ready biodegradability. Anti-cell proliferation and anti-microbial assays suggest that medium-chain length sophorolipids possess therapeutic potential. However, their higher cost of production poses a major barrier to commercial use. Even when grown on a substrate largely composed of fatty acids, a significant portion of the fatty acids are diverted from sophorolipid production due to competition with the β-oxidation pathway. Fatty acids diverted into the β-oxidation pathway undergo irregular cleavage, lowering sophorolipid yield and creating a heterogeneous mixture of products. Full suppression of this pathway would result in undesirable metabolic disruption. Selective suppression of this pathway through genetic engineering could reduce production costs through improving the yield of useful chain lengths.

During its metabolism this bacterium produces pyruvate in the presence of methane. After having inserted the lactate-dehydrogenase gene, pyruvate is converted to have enough lactate for an enzymatic assay to change color when excess amount of methane is present in the environment of the bacteria. In the beginning the bacterium is cultivated in NMS medium containing methanol. For the genetic modification we use the lactate-dehydrogenase gene from Bacillus coagulans.

","Cancer, a genetic disease resulting in uncontrollable cell growth, is mostly caused by somatic mutations acquired throughout an individuals lifetime. Because it induces the increased expression of growth related genes, oncogene amplification is one of the driving forces of cancer cell replication.  Recently, it was discovered that some oncogenes resided on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). Like the DNA on chromosomes, ecDNAs are double stranded. A key difference, however, is the circular shape of ecDNAs; they are able to randomly distribute because they do not have centromeres, which increases heterogeneity in daughter cells. This can cause the cancerous tumors to develop faster resistance to current treatments. To target the ecDNA, we used CRISPR technology to create double strand breaks specifically in the ecDNA. Because ecDNA causes oncogene copy number to increase exponentially, utilizing CRISPR to create breaks in ecDNA decreases cancer cells replication speed.

","Bio-manufacturing is a type of manufacturing that utilizes biological systems to produce commercially important biomaterials. However, it cant be scaled up and put into practice so easily mainly due to the unstable productivity. So, to make bio-manufacturing a more practical technology for synthesis, we build up a more stable and efficient synthesis platform based on bio-cathode. There are 3 systems in our project. To enable E.coli to transfer the extracellular electrons into the cytoplasm as NADH, we construct the Mtr CAB system, the first system we have. Mtr CAB, a protein complex located on the outer membrane, can transfer electrons from the outside of the membrane into the periplasm. The second system is a photoelectric system, generating high energy electrons with CdS nanoparticles as a light harvester. Lastly, we introduce an enzyme as an indicator to demonstrate our projects flexibility and efficiency.

We created two plasmids: sense-respond; and packaging.  The sense-respond plasmid sensed Auto-Inducer 2 (AI-2), a quorum sensing molecule created by most ETEC strains, by expressing LsrR which switches on the Lsr promoter.  Activation of the Lsr promoter expresses Super-Folder Green Fluorescent Protein (sfGFP), indicating the presence of ETEC. The packaging plasmid expresses  a fusion protein consisting of curli fibers and cellulose binding domains. These modified surface proteins permit the bacteria to bind to cellulose, encapsulating the sense-response module.  We envision this genetically engineered machine to be deployed in both the internal and external environment to detect ETEC.
